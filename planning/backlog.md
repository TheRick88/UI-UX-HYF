# Backlog UX/UI

Based on the information obtained during the interview and the user persona
created for the client, we have created the following backlog.

## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [ ] Client needs a portfolio website where he can practice his skills as a
      front end dev and as a photographer.
- [ ] Client needs a photo carrousel where photography can be properly exposed.
- [ ] Client needs a contact form where clients can reach him.
- [ ] Client needs a footer where people can find his social platforms.

## Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

- [ ] Client should have an area dedicated to Vlogs about the creation of the
      photography with tips and advises to fellow photographers and/or
      beginners.

## Could-Haves

> would be really cool ... if there's time

- [ ] Client could have an intra-page where people can create a discussion board
      for his work for tips, comments and feedback.
